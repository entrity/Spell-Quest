${SPEECH}Oh, hello, dear. Welcome to $(alt Hattifattener Academy)!

You're probably wondering what you have to do now that you're here. Most students come here with that question. Can you guess what? You don't have to do anything. You can pursue whatever studies you please or none at all.

Some students come here because they think it will help them on their quest to obtain the grand treasure. If that is your aim, you really need only two studies:

1. The secrets of $(alt encryption) on the $(alt Path of Shadow)
2. The $(alt first level) of the $(alt Path of Teleportation)

Students who want the most $(red shaded secrets) would do well to pursue the secrets of $(alt steganography) in the $(alt Path of Shadow), but this requires some familiarity with the $(alt Path of Binary).

Follow your heart, dearie, and you'll not go wrong.
