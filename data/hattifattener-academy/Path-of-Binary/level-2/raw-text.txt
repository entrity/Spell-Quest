There's a merrow in the lake, yes a merrow in the lake.
	And should you tarry after dark, the fiend your soul may take.
Down to its wat'ry lair, oh, its darksome wat'ry lair,
	All stolen souls in clenching fingers merrows carry there.
The merrow with its rheumy eyes, its yellowed rheumy eyes
	Will dress in hats and coats and gloves, each ghostly, captive prize.
