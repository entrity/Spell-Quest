## Getting Started

### Downloading

You have two options for downloading:

1. Save and then unzip the file at https://github.com/entrity/Spell-Quest/archive/master.zip
2. Use git: `git clone --depth 1 git@github.com:entrity/Spell-Quest.git`

### Mac OS

Double-click the `start.command` file (or the `restart.command` file, since they both do the same thing on your first execution).

If this doesn't work because of a lack of permissions to execute a file downloaded from the internet, open a **Terminal** (from your Applications), then follow the instructions listed under **Linux** below.

### Linux

In your terminal:

```bash
cd Spell-Quest || cd $HOME/Downloads/Spell-Quest-master
./start.sh
```
