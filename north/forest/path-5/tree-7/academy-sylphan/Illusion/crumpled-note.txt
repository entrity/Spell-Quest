The output of any program can be sent to a file instead of being printed visibly to the terminal. Use the ">" character to specify this redirection, following the following pattern:

	program [parameters...] > savefile

For example:

	find . -iname "foo*" > record.txt

This ">" redirect will completely overwrite any pre-existing content in the target file. As an alternative, use the ">>" redirect. The ">>" redirect appends new content to the pre-existing content.
